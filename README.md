# Human Computer Interaction Project 2: Car Dashboard

## Part 1

When looking for car Dashboards online, you can find a lot of futuristic looking light up screens. See these two images below for examples:

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/Images/future-dash-1.jpg" width=410 >
<img src="/Images/future-dash-2.webp" width=590>
</div>

While these dashboards are nice and clean looking, they are not a realistic representation of what appears in most cars today. These kinds of dash boards are great for educational purposes. You can use them to represent a normal dashboard in order to, for example, explain what different dashboard lights do such as in the following example:

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/Images/lots-of-information.webp" width=1000>
</div>
