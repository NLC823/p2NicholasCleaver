#### Introduction
When looking for car Dashboards online, you can find a lot of futuristic looking light up screens. See these two images below for examples:

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/Images/future-dash-1.jpg" width=410 >
<img src="/Images/future-dash-2.webp" width=590>
</div>

While these dashboards are nice and clean looking, they are not a realistic representation of what appears in most cars today. These kinds of dash boards are great for educational purposes. You can use them to represent a normal dashboard in order to, for example, explain what different dashboard lights do such as in the following image:

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/Images/lots-of-information.webp" width=1000>
</div>

Dashboards can contain a lot of different information and part of being a responsible driver is knowing what the different warning lights mean so you can take care of your car. It is important to know which lights are errors that it would be catastrophic to drive with and which ones are minor inconveniences that will need to be looked at eventually but are not critical to your safety. Take a look at the 4 examples from below of more realistic car dashboards:

<div style="text-align: center">
  <img src="/Images/real-dash-1.jpg" width=500>
  <img src="/Images/real-dash-2.jpg" width=500>
  <img src="/Images/real-dash-3.jpg" width=500>
  <img src="/Images/real-dash-4.jpg" width=500>
</div>

The top left image shown here is still a widely used design today. This is one of the original concepts that people liked and was used for a long time. In more modern cars, such as the top right and bottom left depictions from above, there is an added LCD screen in the center. This seems to be the most popular dashboard design method for newer cars today. Finally, on the bottom right, you can the dashboard to the Honda e compact EV. This dashboard is a little different with information shown all the way across the car instead of immediately in front of the driver.

#### Pros and Cons
First, let's start off with the futuristic electronic dashboards shown at the beginning.
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pros:</strong> the pros of this design, as mentioned above, are learning and education. This design does not come with the clutter involved in an actual car dashboard and can be used to clearly illustrate concepts. It is easy to correlate to your own car by recognizing the symbols and makes it easier to grasp what is being communicated. These dashboards can inflate the size of the symbols to show you what they look like when bigger which can also be helpful when learning.</li>
  <li><strong>Cons:</strong> the cons of this design are that this is not exactly what you see. Yes, it makes it easy to understand the symbols with their enlarged depictions, but if you are not aware, you might not recognize the same symbol in your own car. In real life the glowing lights often make it more difficult to depict the details of these symbols. Another note is that many cars have different indicator lights and looking at one specific example of these electronic dashboards might not show you what you have in your car.</li>
</ul>

Next, let's look at the slightly older design that is still highly popular from the top left image.
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pros:</strong> the pros of this design include the iconic circles indicating different information. This is the most common feature amongst car dashboards and is a clear recognizable way to see the most important information. This design features four different needles that point to different pieces of important information. The dials are big enough to be clearly seen and the most important dial, the speed one, is in the middle.</li>
  <li><strong>Cons:</strong> the cons of this design include the numbers displayed at the bottom center of the speed dial. These numbers do not have clear labels and someone new to driving might not understand what they mean. Also, the outdated button between the center dial and the right dial to reset the trip can be seen as a con. While not strictly bad, as this design is an older one and the technology we have now did not exist at the time, this button is not labeled and might even be overlooked as a button if you did not know what you were looking for.</li>
</ul>

Next, let's look at the more modern spin off of the previous design depicted in the top right and bottom left images.
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pros:</strong> the pros of these designs include the same iconic circular dials with a more updated LCD screen in the center for further information. This type of design keeps the clear and easily seen important information from the previous design on dials and puts the less important information into a more organized screen where it is clear what you are looking at. The bottom left design, in particular, is great because it still has a dial for everything the older design had a dial for. Organized in this way, it is easy to see a ton of information and, with the LCD screen, you can be more clear about the information. Warnings and alerts still have indicator lights on the dashboard, but now you can give more information about them on the central LCD screen. No longer do you need to memorize what the different symbols mean because the LCD screen will explain the errors.</li>
  <li><strong>Cons:</strong> the cons of these designs include the interface being more complicated to interact with. No longer is there a single button to reset the trip on your car, you likely have 4 or more different buttons to interact with the central LCD screen. The control mechanisms are not depicted in these images, but with the increased functionality comes more complicated controls. The user may mistake these controls for other controls or distract themselves while driving in an attempt to figure out what control is the one they are looking for.</li>
</ul>

Finally, let's look at the design for the Honda e compact EV shown in the bottom right image.
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pros:</strong> the pros of this design include the plethora of information that is available to you. This dashboard has a lot of space available as it spans the entire width of the car. This space, properly used, will be able to show exactly what the user needs clearly and understandably. This is like the step up from the numbers below the speed dial to the LCD screen between two dials, but for the entire dashboard.</li>
  <li><strong>Cons:</strong> the cons of this design include the design no longer being recognizable. While this may be the trend where car dashboards are heading, the recognizable iconic circular dials are missing. There are times in which the dashboard may not even show how fast you are going and the controls involving this are likely very complicated. Like the step up in complexity to the single button controlling the trip on your dashboard to the 4+ buttons used to control your LCD screen in the center of your dashboard, this takes the 4+ buttons to control the central LCD screen and expands it to the entire width of the car. I do not know which parts of the dashboard touchscreen vs being controlled by buttons, but either option is problematic to the driver. This complicated of a design is going to have complicated controls and, unless the user has been trained on proper uses, they will likely be distracted by their controls while driving. This is a danger to themselves and others around them on the road.</li>
</ul>

#### Summary

In summary, the more complicated the design for the car dashboard, the more complicated the controls. The levels of complication vary from a single button with 3 numbers to an LCD screen spanning the entire width of the car. It is up to the car designer to find the happy medium where the important information can be displayed in a visually appealing way while also keeping the controls simple. This can be a hard task because as most people get more experience with common features of handheld devices, such as smartphones, certain controls will be seen as simple and understandable, but to those who donâ€™t use these devices as much, they will be confusing and unintuitive. For this reason, I think the best design of the ones I listed above is the design with the central LCD screen. This design keeps the iconic and recognizable circular indicators of the car dashboard while also having a central LCD screen to see details of error messages and other information. This design can use 4-5 buttons to control every aspect of the screen and is not too complicated for anyone to learn. This design will not be distracting while you drive and is still able to get the most important information to you clearly.


## Part 2


For this section, I will use my own car dashboard as an example. I have one with a central LCD screen and two circular gauges as with the top right and bottom left from the section above. Uses of the dashboard include displaying information; there is a lot of information that is either important to know while driving or just handy to know in general and this is displayed on the dashboard.

Some of the more common information to look at for me is as follows:
- Speed MPH
- Gas level
- Miles until empty
- Compass
- Time
- Temperature
- Engine RPM
- Engine Heat
- Cruise control

Some of the less common information shown on the dashboard is:
- Speed km/h
- Bright lights on
- Mileage
- Car mode (Park, Drive / Gear, Reverse)
- Car mode (economy / sport / regular)
- Warning Lights
- Warning details
- Trip A miles
- Trip B miles
- Average Speed
- Fuel Economy (Average miles per gallon)
- Settings

There are 5 controls that the user can use to interact with the dashboard split amongst 2 buttons and a switch. All of these controls are located along the left side of the steering wheel and the user can effectively activate all of them with their thumb while still holding the steering wheel with the rest of their hand. See the image below along with the following bullet points for an explanation:

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/Images/dash-controls.jpg" height=500>
</div>

- <strong>Switch Screen Button:</strong> this button is the one that looks like two squares overlapping each other; it is the second closest to the bottom in the image. This button is used to switch the screen forwards 1 screen. There are several different screens on the LCD screen and the only purpose of this button is to go forwards through them.
- <strong>Back Button:</strong> this button is the one immediately below the switch screen button. It looks like an arrow pointing backwards. This button has two uses. First, if you have entered a menu, this button will return you to the previous page, otherwise, if you are not in a menu, it will act as a go back 1 screen button and return you to the screen before the one you are on currently.
- <strong>Control Switch:</strong> This switch is the one down and to the left of the source button; it is the switch that says enter on it. This third and final control piece of the LCD screen is the most important and is composed of 3 parts flip up, flip down, and press. When you flip the switch in either direction it automatically returns to the center.
  - <strong>Flip up:</strong> flipping this switch up will move the selection up 1 item.
  - <strong>Flip down:</strong> flipping this switch down will move the selection down 1 item.
  - <strong>Press:</strong> pressing the switch acts as an "Enter" function, hence the label. This will use the currently selected item and bring you to a screen with more information about that item.
