# Human Computer Interaction Project 2: Car Dashboard

## Part 1

When looking for car Dashboards online, you can find a lot of futuristic looking light up screens. See these two images below for examples:

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/Images/future-dash-1.jpg" width=410 >
<img src="/Images/future-dash-2.webp" width=590>
</div>

While these dashboards are nice and clean looking, they are not a realistic representation of what appears in most cars today. These kinds of dash boards are great for educational purposes. You can use them to represent a normal dashboard in order to, for example, explain what different dashboard lights do such as in the following example:

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/Images/lots-of-information.webp" width=1000>
</div>

Dashboards can contain a lot of different information and part of being a responsible driver is knowing what the different warning lights mean so you can take care of your car. It is important to know which lights are errors that it would be catastrophic to drive with and which ones are minor inconvienences that will need to be looked at eventually, but are not critical to your saftey. Take a look at the 4 examples from below of more realistic car dashboards:

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/Images/real-dash-1.jpg" width=500>
<img src="/Images/real-dash-2.jpg" width=500>
<img src="/Images/real-dash-3.jpg" width=500>
<img src="/Images/real-dash-4.jpg" width=500>
</div>
